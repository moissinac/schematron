# Contributor Licensing Grants #

The Schematron code on Google Code will use the MIT license. However, it can also be made available under any other OSI license if necessary and convenient on request. The code has been copyright Rick Jellife or joint as Rick Jelliffe and Academia Sinica Computing Centre.

Prior to being hosted on Google Code, the Schematron code has used the very similar zlib/libpng license (and at one stage the Artistic license.) Code and bug fixes contributed over the years by users has been incorporated with implied contributor permission under those licenses.

In order to satisfy the requirements of some OSI licenses, we will attempt to get explicit comments from the various contributors named in the Schematron code over the last decade who have kindly suggested changes to the source code and bug fixes, small or large. Following are some explicit grants from individual contributors, in alphabetical order, allowing use under the MIT license. (Note: Rick Jelliffe does not believe that these are strictly necessary. They are included for the information of potential adopters who may have extra-careful policy on these issues.)

The issue of becoming an open source project was raised right from the outset by early key contributor Dr Oliver Becker, whose team re-factored Schematron to use the skeleton API: '_Would it be reasonable to change Schematron into a real open source project supported by several contributors (hosted on sourceforge, for example)? ... I think a little effort to concentrate the Schematron activities makes a lot of sense._' (post to [xml-dev 02 Aug 2000](http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/200008/msg00072.html))

Schematron has been hosted at Academia Sinica, SourceForge, and Schematron.com prior to the new move to Google Code. (Code on the first two sites may still be up, however it implements the old Schematron 1.5 specification which has been obsoleted by ISO Schematron.)
