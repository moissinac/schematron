# Running Schematron with Eclipse #

See [Schematron Eclipse Plugin](http://www.castledesigns.co.uk/schematron-ep.html).

It seems this plugin courtesy of Castle Designs uses a processing instruction: `<?schematron-schema href="..\TCDL\schematron\tcdl2.0.tsdtf.sch"?>.`

Note that because Schematron is used by SML (Service Modeling Language), it is mentioned or implemented? by the Eclipse [Cosmos project](http://wiki.eclipse.org/images/a/ae/SML-Validation-v7.pdf)
