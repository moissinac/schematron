# Running Schematron with Perl #

There is a Schematron implementation at [CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/~khampton/XML-Schematron-1.07/lib/XML/Schematron/XPath.pm) which implements a very early version of Schematron, without namespaces and using XPath.

An example for running is [here](http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/KHAMPTON/XML-Schematron-1.07/lib/XML/Schematron.pm).  See also the 2002 article by Kip Hampton on [XML.COM](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/01/23/perl-schematron.html?page=2)

Readers may find it convenient. If you need more powerful, consider running the XSLT scripts on this site.
